<h2> This Site's Initial Build Tutorial/Walkthrough </h2>
<p>Here, I will document the steps I am taking to build a simple website "from scratch".  
    You can't really do anything from scratch on a computer anymore, but it's about as close as you can get.  This will not be a step-by-step tutorial.  If you have any experience or knowledge and want to create a responsive, clean, and simple website but need a bit of guide, this should do.
</p>
<p>Before creating this webpage, I had to get a few other things setup.
    This is what the home page looks like as I create and link to this page:

</p>
<p>There is a surprising amount of tasks already accomplished here, so let's just bullet our way through them:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Get a Place to <b>Host</b> HTML, CSS, and Javascript
        <ol type="a">
            <li>I am using GitHub Pages - It is simple, free, and let's you focus on the code</li>
            <li>Follow this tutorial here: <a href="https://pages.github.com/">pages.github.com</a>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Select "I don't know" to download GitHub Desktop</li>
                    <li>You can use notepad to create the index.html file</li>
                    <li>The next step is setting up a better way to code</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    <li>Setup Your <b>Dev Environment</b>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Get an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) (aka Code Editor)
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>For simple web code, you can use Notepad++, which I have used for many lines of code</li>
                    <li>VS Code is going to be a very popular recommendation</li>
                    <li><a href="https://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> is one I just downloaded to try out because I'm not that fond of VS Code</li>
                    <li>You could also use a community/free edition of Visual Studio, but that's a bit overkill</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>All of these will allow you to open the files and/or folder where your pages reside</li>
            <li>VS Code has a "Run and Debug", but you can also just open the files in a web browser</li>
            <li>Make a simple change to index.html, go to GitHub to commit your changes (to Main to keep it simple)</li>
        </ol>
        <ol type="a"></ol>
    </li>
    <li>Download <b>W3.css</b>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>A full tutorial is available at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/">w3schools.com/w3css/</a></li>
            <li>W3.css may technically count as a framework, but it's just a few pre-defined classes</li>
            <li>Not quite from scratch, but close enough</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Create another, <b>Site Specific CSS</b> File</li>
    <li>Progress Check
        <ol type="a">
            <li>At this point you should have an index.html, w3.css, and your css file</li>
            <li>You should be able to make changes to index.html and see the results in a browser</li>
            <li>You should then be able to use GitHub Desktop to commit the changes and see the results on your website (host)</li>
            <li>If you can't do this, review the steps, and sometimes you just have to start over</li>
            <li>If you did get this far, CONGRATS!</li>
            <li>Let's keep going and start building the site</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Get a <b>Logo and Name</b>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>The name of my site here is obviously based on my GitHub username</li>
            <li>The logo was created by Copilot (using Dall-e)</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Create the <b>Site Header</b>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Add the logo</li>
            <li>Add the site title and sub title</li>
            <li>We'll make this look better in just a bit</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Add a <b>Second Page</b>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Create the file</li>
            <li>Copy the Header</li>
            <li>Add some other text</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Progress Check
        <ol type="a">
            <li>This is where I started this page</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<ol>
    <li>Improve <b>Site Layout</b>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Make the logo and title horizontal
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Make the logo and title horizontal</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Add a sidebar to hold the menu</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Build the <b>Sidebar Menu</b>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Subtopic</li>
        </ol>
